# Proposal for topic

## Research these headings
#### Bioagent methods against malaria and dengue
- Bioagent is a bacterium, virus, protozoan, parasite, fungus, or toxin that can be used for a specfic purpose.

#### Other research or activity on drones for this purpose


#### The DJI T10 and how the GCS works 
- The DJI Agras T10 has an 8L spray tank and convinient for spraying bioagent. The battery and tank can be quickly attached and detached to make refilling more efficient.

(Specifications)
- More information on the specs can be found here: https://www.dji.com/uk/t10/specs 
- Has a Spherical Radar System

(User Manual)
https://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/t10/T10_User_Manual_v1.4_EN.pdf
- Flight modes. Default is P mode. This is positon mode. The drone will hold its position and altitude. A-mode is for Attitude, can only maintain altitude using the barometer. A mode is not used for positioning.

- Operation modes: A-B modes, Manual and Manual Plus.

- 


#### SERF & puddles of water at SERF


#### Investigate where and who sells the biofluid they talk about in the videos and papers

 
#### Papers on finding water bodies with drone and multispectral imagery


#### Vegetation indices (VI), please learn some basic ideas about VI
- What is a vegetation index? Answer: A vegetation index is a mathematical formula that uses the reflectance of light from a target to determine the amount of chlorophyll in the target.

- What is the difference between NDVI and EVI? Answer: NDVI is a vegetation index that uses the reflectance of near-infrared and red light to determine the amount of chlorophyll in the target. EVI is a vegetation index that uses the reflectance of near-infrared, red, and blue light to determine the amount of chlorophyll in the target.

#### UAV-spray application in vineyards and spray system adjustments effects on canopy deposit, coverage, and off-target losses
[UAV-spray application in vineywards](https://github.com/DonMMK/Drones-against-Malaria-and-Dengue/blob/main/Read/1-s2.0-S004896972204390X-main.pdf)  

##### Important points
(Highlights)  

- The UAV-spray system flight path plays a
key role in vineyards spray applications.
- Conventional nozzle combined with high UAV speed results in higher canopy deposit: 
  * What is canopy deposit?
- Spray applications above the canopy maximised deposition compared to broadcast ones.
- Spray applications above the canopy also minimised ground losses.
- Spray volume rate from UAV must be increased to guarantee a minimum deposit density.

(Abstract)  
- When the spray process is improved less bioagent is used which reduces contamination of the environment and the cost of the bioagent. Maximise the amount of bioagent that is deposited on the target and reduce off-target losses.
- Variables changed across 12 configurations
1. Different flight modes(band, broadcast)
2. Different nozzle types (conventional and air inclusion) 
3. Different UAV cruise speeds (1 and 3 ms-1)
4. Using UAV spray system or airblast spray system

-  Results for each varibale changed 
1. Band spray affects application efficiency by increasing canopy deposition.
2. Conventional nozzle type showed better coverage and lower ground loss.
3. 
4. The conventional airblast sprayer, operated at a low spray application rate, showed higher canopy coverage and lower
ground losses in comparison to the best UAV-spray system configuration.

(Introduction)  
- In mechanized commercial vinyards pesticide residue in food reports are increasing (0.4% to 0.9%).
