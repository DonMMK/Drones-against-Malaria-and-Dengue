# Proposal for topic

## Research these headings
### Bioagent methods against malaria and dengue


### Other research or activity on drones for this purpose


### The DJI T10 and how the GCS works 


### SERF & puddles of water at SERF


### Investigate where and who sells the biofluid they talk about in the videos and papers

 
### Papers on finding water bodies with drone and multispectral imagery


 

### Vegetation indices (VI), please learn some basic ideas about VI
