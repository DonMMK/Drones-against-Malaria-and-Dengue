## Topics to be Researched
#### Bioagent methods against malaria and dengue
- Bioagent is a bacterium, virus, protozoan, parasite, fungus, or toxin that can be used for a specfic purpose.

#### Other research or activity on drones for this purpose


#### The DJI T10 and how the GCS works 
- The DJI Agras T10 has an 8L spray tank and convinient for spraying bioagent. The battery and tank can be quickly attached and detached to make refilling more efficient.

(Specifications)
- More information on the specs can be found here: https://www.dji.com/uk/t10/specs 
- Has a Spherical Radar System

(User Manual)

- Flight modes. Default is P mode. This is positon mode. The drone will hold its position and altitude. A-mode is for Attitude, can only maintain altitude using the barometer. A mode is not used for positioning.

- Operation modes: A-B modes, Manual and Manual Plus.

- 


#### SERF & puddles of water at SERF


#### Investigate where and who sells the biofluid they talk about in the videos and papers

 
#### Papers on finding water bodies with drone and multispectral imagery


#### Vegetation indices (VI), please learn some basic ideas about VI
- What is a vegetation index? Answer: A vegetation index is a mathematical formula that uses the reflectance of light from a target to determine the amount of chlorophyll in the target.
- What are Vegetation indices? (Taken from Narmilan's Paper: detection of White Leaf Disease...) 

- What is the difference between NDVI and EVI? Answer: NDVI is a vegetation index that uses the reflectance of near-infrared and red light to determine the amount of chlorophyll in the target. EVI is a vegetation index that uses the reflectance of near-infrared, red, and blue light to determine the amount of chlorophyll in the target.
