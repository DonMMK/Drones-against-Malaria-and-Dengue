#### UAV-spray application in vineyards and spray system adjustments effects on canopy deposit, coverage, and off-target losses

##### Important points
(Highlights)  

- The UAV-spray system flight path plays a
key role in vineyards spray applications.
- Conventional nozzle combined with high UAV speed results in higher canopy deposit: 
  * What is canopy deposit?
- Spray applications above the canopy maximised deposition compared to broadcast ones.
- Spray applications above the canopy also minimised ground losses.
- Spray volume rate from UAV must be increased to guarantee a minimum deposit density.

(Abstract)  
- When the spray process is improved less bioagent is used which reduces contamination of the environment and the cost of the bioagent. Maximise the amount of bioagent that is deposited on the target and reduce off-target losses.
- Variables changed across 12 configurations
1. Different flight modes(band, broadcast)
2. Different nozzle types (conventional and air inclusion) 
3. Different UAV cruise speeds (1 and 3 ms-1)
4. Using UAV spray system or airblast spray system

-  Results for each varibale changed 
1. Band spray affects application efficiency by increasing canopy deposition.
2. Conventional nozzle type showed better coverage and lower ground loss.
3. 
4. The conventional airblast sprayer, operated at a low spray application rate, showed higher canopy coverage and lower
ground losses in comparison to the best UAV-spray system configuration.

(Introduction)  
- In mechanized commercial vinyards pesticide residue in food reports are increasing (0.4% to 0.9%) (EFSA, 2021).
- During spray applications a considerable amount of chemical becomes off-target losses.
- Precision agricultural techniques have improved the spary applications resulkting in benefits in reducing environmental and human contamination risks, improving PPP benefits and raising food quality standards.
- Aerial Spraying from UAVs is challenegin in terms of UAV path planning definition but in recent years has been spreading worldwide. It is largely used in Asia.
- 1) Cruise speed 2) flight height 3) number of spray passages per each row 4) nozzle size and type 5) liquid pressure 6) number of active nozzles.
