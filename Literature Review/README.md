#### UAV-spray application in vineyards and spray system adjustments effects on canopy deposit, coverage, and off-target losses

##### Important points
(Highlights)  

- The UAV-spray system flight path plays a
key role in vineyards spray applications.
- Conventional nozzle combined with high UAV speed results in higher canopy deposit: 
  * What is canopy deposit?
- Spray applications above the canopy maximised deposition compared to broadcast ones.
- Spray applications above the canopy also minimised ground losses.
- Spray volume rate from UAV must be increased to guarantee a minimum deposit density.

(Abstract)  
- When the spray process is improved less bioagent is used which reduces contamination of the environment and the cost of the bioagent. Maximise the amount of bioagent that is deposited on the target and reduce off-target losses.
- Variables changed across 12 configurations
1. Different flight modes(band, broadcast)
2. Different nozzle types (conventional and air inclusion) 
3. Different UAV cruise speeds (1 and 3 ms-1)
4. Using UAV spray system or airblast spray system

-  Results for each variable changed 
1. Band spray affects application efficiency by increasing canopy deposition.
2. Conventional nozzle type showed better coverage and lower ground loss.
3. 
4. The conventional airblast sprayer, operated at a low spray application rate, showed higher canopy coverage and lower
ground losses in comparison to the best UAV-spray system configuration.

(Introduction)  
- In mechanized commercial vinyards pesticide residue in food reports are increasing (0.4% to 0.9%) (EFSA, 2021).
- During spray applications a considerable amount of chemical becomes off-target losses.
- Precision agricultural techniques have improved the spary applications resulkting in benefits in reducing environmental and human contamination risks, improving PPP benefits and raising food quality standards.
- Aerial Spraying from UAVs is challenegin in terms of UAV path planning definition but in recent years has been spreading worldwide. It is largely used in Asia.
- 1) Cruise speed 2) flight height 3) number of spray passages per each row 4) nozzle size and type 5) liquid pressure 6) number of active nozzles.
- The downwash effect of UAV rotors is important in increasing the canopy deposition in crops, especially in bush or tree crops. This effect is used to move foliage and convey droplets into the canopy, increasing the chances of reaching the innermost leaves. Researchers have highlighted difficulties in penetrating canopies due to their shape and density in citrus orchards. The UAV path and flight mode are crucial in relation to the planting system and tree shapes.

2.9. Statistical and data analysis

(Results and discussion)
3.1. Canopy deposit

3.2. Canopy coverage

3.3. Ground deposit

3.4. In-depth analysis of the 1-way band ﬂight mode

3.4.1. Canopy deposit: spatial canopy spray deposit distribution and canopy penetration

3.4.2. Ground deposit: spatial distribution of the ground losses

3.5. Comparison between UAV and airblast sprayers

(Conclusion)  
- The field trials allowed to identify which of the operational parameters were optimal for vineyard spraying.
- 1) Flight mode was the paramter that affected spraying the most. UAV is aligned with the vine row orientation, made it possible to target the spray on the crop canopy as much as possible, thus maximising the deposition and minimising the off target losses on the ground.
- 2) Nozzle type also affects the efficiency of the application
- 3) Cruise speed was set to 3ms-1 to reduce spray loses
- 4) The spray rate which was set for 53 L ha-1 was demonstrated to be insufficient to guarantee an adequate spray deposit density for insecticide or fungicide spray applications.
- 5) The spray application rate must be increased using the UAV-spray system
- 6) Deposit distribution shows how the relative distance between the spray source and the target is a key parameter irrespective of application technique.
